      SUBROUTINE cphotrate(phi,alon,day,SunHr,ZenAng,Cloudv)

!       2016 Matthias Karl, HZG, This is an original CityChem subroutine
!       The subroutine calculates the photolysis rates.
!       The Zenith angle (ZenAng) is calculated with equations from
!       Madronich. The formulae from Paltridge and Platt (1977) are
!       used to calculate the solar height angle as function of
!       date, daytime, latitude and longitude.
!       The parameterization for the calculation of photolysis rates is
!       adopted from Walker et al. (NILU TR 13/2003).
